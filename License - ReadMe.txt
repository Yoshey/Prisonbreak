License Terms:

You MUST link to the official Prisonbreak Discord inside your map's steam page description.
Available Links:
https://discord.gg/RH6DsH4
http://bit.do/BAJAIL

(Releasing a complete Jailbreak map makes you eligible for the "Map Maker" tag and to receive a category dedicated for your map, but is not guaranteed.)

You MAY NOT remove or change any of the watermarks (e.g. "Prisonbreak By Yoshey; Source Code By Mottflyer") inside the Prisonbreak Gamemode itself AND they MUST be fully visible.

You MAY NOT remove or modify the Donator Module in any way that disadvantages Yoshey's Patreons.
(You may add content or your own Donators, but new features must be accessible for Yoshey's Patreons too.)

-

Failure to meet these requirements will result in your map being taken down from the Pavlov Workshop.
